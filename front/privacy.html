      <h1>MiroTeX Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>MiroTeX knows privacy is a serious matter. We neither collect nor store any information about users beyond the minimum needed to provide the service and maintain its quality.</p>
      
      <p>Your images are stored on our servers in unencrypted form for a few seconds while they are transferred from your browser to your Miro board. During this time they are publicly available for anyone to view, but access requires knowing a randomly generated URL for your image. This is a technical requirement imposed by Miro's tools and we would avoid this situation if they make it feasible to do so in the future. The short duration of storage and random identifier make it extremely unlikely that your image would be accessed by any third party during this step.</p>

      <p>The only other records we gather are transient network and user id information for the purposes of maintaining application stability and preventing abuse of the service.</p>

      <p>MiroTeX and its author are not affiliated with Miro, beyond developing an addon for their product.</p>
